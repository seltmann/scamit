			<p>SCAMIT was formed in 1982 with the goal of promoting the study of marine invertebrate taxonomy in southern California and developing a regionally standardized taxonomy. To accomplish this, SCAMIT provides a regular monthly forum to address problems in taxonomy, organizes taxonomic workshops, and maintains a reference collection and library of taxonomic literature. SCAMlT's activities contribute to the scientific value of the many surveys of marine benthic invertebrate communities conducted in southern California by assuring standardized taxonomy and compatibility between various taxonomic data sets.</p>
			<h2>SCAMIT Activities:</h2>
			<p>Members meet monthly (usually on the second Monday) in various locations around southern California. Our meetings include taxonomic workshops and/or speakers who lecture on the systematics and related ecology of a particular taxonomic group. Special workshops, by visiting investigators and experts from various institutions and museums, are also an integral part of SCAMIT. Descriptive information and comparative characteristics of species examined during these meetings are summarized in voucher sheets and tables distributed in the SCAMIT Newsletter.   </p>
			<p>In addition to our standardization program, SCAMIT supports with a grant program member projects to improve the quality of taxonomic data through development and revision of taxonomic keys and publication of new species descriptions. In 1994, SCAMIT developed a comprehensive listing of local marine invertebrates from the infaunal monitoring programs in the Southern California Bight. This Taxonomic Listing of Soft Bottom Macroinvertebrates is periodically updated as knowledge of the marine invertebrate fauna expands. </p>
			
			<p>The 5th Edition
			of <b><a href="tools/Ed%205%20corrected%20final.pdf">A
			Taxonomic Listing of Benthic Macro- and
			Megainvertebrates from Infaunal & Epibenthic
			Monitoring and Research Programs in the Southern California
			Bight</a></b> has now been released and is
			available here for downloading.  The 5th
			Edition expands on the 4th by the addition of
			newly reported taxa from POTW monitoring
			programs and the Southern California Bight
			Regional Monitoring Project.</p>

			<h2>SCAMIT Support</h2>
			<p>We are an entirely volunteer non-profit organization, with no employees. Costs of newsletter production and distribution, along with publication support grants and stipends for out-of-area guest speakers are virtually our only expenses. Dues from membership partially offset these costs, but we also depend on financial support from outside agencies. Equally important is support of the agencies who allow their officer employees to conduct SCAMIT business as part of their work, and the companies and agencies that allow employee participation at the monthly meetings. Without such support it would be very difficult to find time to conduct the organization's business. . We are also supported by the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (LACMNH), which provides us the physical space to maintain our voucher specimen and literature collections. As an organization we owe all of the above contributors a debt of gratitude.</p>
			<h2> SCAMIT Members</h2>
			<p>Initially formed by taxonomists associated with southern California wastewater treatment programs, the SCAMIT membership has diversified over the years. It now also includes consultants, museum scientists, and both students and researchers in the academic realm. Despite our local origins we have members from one coast of the U. S. to the other, and a scattered contingent of international members. Distance prevents most from active meeting participation, but we attempt to include everyone through the newsletter.</p>
