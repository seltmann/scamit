			<h2>November  Meetings:</h2>
			<p>It has recently been decided by the SCAMIT Officers and those members that attended the "Future of SCAMIT" meeting in February that starting this year membership renewals will be due once a year in May. </p>

			<p>This is the beginning of our fiscal year and this will hopefully simplify the renewal process for not only the Treasurer but all members. This also allows SCAMIT a general yearly operating budget with which to plan major expenses. General reminders will be posted on the website and in the newsletter and if members haven't renewed by the end of May separate personal reminders will be sent to members in June. Since the majority of our membership renews between April and June we feel this change will impact the least number of members. If you have just recently renewed we will give you 4 - 5 months of free membership, so your membership would last until May of 2004. </p>

		<p>	New members may join at any time and will be informed of our annual dues then. It has always been SCAMIT's policy not to drop members late with their dues, especially long term members. This will continue. As always if this presents any sort of difficulty for anyone please contact the Treasurer, Cheryl Brantley
