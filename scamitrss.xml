<description>&#x3C;i&#x3E;3 November 2010&#x3C;br /&#x3E; The Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI), which is located in Charleston, South Carolina, has an Assistant Marine Scientist position available for an individual with experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy/systematics, preferably with research interest in biodiversity and/or biogeography. This position involves directing operation of the Southeastern Regional Taxonomic Center (SERTC), including curating and expanding the Center&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s specimen collection. The successful candidate will also be expected to conduct original research using the Center&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s resources, pursue extramural funding to ensure the Center&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s longevity and relevance, meet staffing needs, participate in educational activities, and represent the Center and promote its activities among staff of other institutions, universities and museums.&#x3C;br /&#x3E; This position requires a Ph.D. in marine science, zoology, ecology or biology, experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy and systematics, knowledge of basic collection curation, demonstrated strong technical writing skills, and good organizational and managerial skills. This position is currently fully funded for a period of one year at a starting base salary of $40,000 with full benefits, but has the potential to continue contingent upon the success of recent funding requests. Applicants must be legally authorized to work in the United States.&#x3C;br /&#x3E; The SERTC is located within MRRI at the Marine Resources Center adjacent to Charleston Harbor. Institute staff interact routinely and extensively with staff at other facilities located at the Center, including the College of Charleston&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s Grice Marine Laboratory, NOAA&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research, NOAA&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s Hollings Marine Laboratory, NIST, and the Medical University of South Carolina&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s Marine Biomedical Program. The successful applicant may apply for an adjunct faculty appointment in the College of Charleston&#x26;acirc;&#x26;#128;&#x26;#153;s Graduate Program in Marine Biology and/or Masters of Environmental Studies program.

Primarily our work consists of monitoring for the aggregate industry and, more recently, the renewable energy sector. Our staff comprise of an experienced team of marine biologists who are self-motivated and work to tight deadlines.&#x3C;br /&#x3E; We are looking for a senior marine macrobenthic taxonomist whose primary role will be to undertake analysis of benthic samples and identification of all taxonomic groups, together with training of junior staff in benthic taxonomy. You will be educated to at least degree level in marine biology or a related discipline and also have at least two years experience in marine invertebrate analysis and taxonomic identification. While you will be mostly lab-based, you will also be required to participate in fieldwork.&#x3C;br /&#x3E; MESL participates in the NMBAQC scheme, and in conjunction with this, we run our own internal training scheme to develop the taxonomic skills of our laboratory staff. We also encourage continued professional development for all our staff.&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Please email your CV to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;mailto:lab@seasurvey.co.uk&#x22;&#x3E;lab@seasurvey.co.uk&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Sara Marzialetti&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Senior Marine Ecologist&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Marine Ecological Surveys Limited&#x3C;br /&#x3E; 3 Palace Yard Mews&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Bath&#x3C;br /&#x3E; BA1 2NH&#x3C;br /&#x3E; England&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Tel: 01225 442211&#x3C;br /&#x3E; Fax: 01225 444411&#x3C;/i&#x3E;

<description>Don Cadien will lead a review of new Arthropoda: Crustacea literature with emphasis on papers reporting newly described/reported species to S. Cal. or revisionary papers effecting name usage or taxonomic hierarchy of our local fauna. Dr. Mary Wicksten will be attend the meeting to contribute and discuss her recent work on Eastern Pacific decapods. I hope all our local crustacean taxonomists will plan on attending this meeting. Don will be sending out more information prior to the meeting.</description>

<description>All SCAMIT members and their families are invited to attend. In addition, the officers decided it would be neighborly to invite members and their families of our two sister groups to join us. Invitations will be extended to the members of the Southwestern Association of Freshwater Invertebrate Taxonomists (SAFIT) and the Southern California Association of Ichthyological Taxonomists and Ecologists (SCAITE). It should make for a lively event. More details later.</description>
