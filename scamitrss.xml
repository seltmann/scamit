<description>&#x3C;i&#x3E;4 Nov 2009&#x3C;/i&#x3E;
&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 The California Ocean Science Trust (OST) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) public benefit corporation established pursuant to the California Ocean Resources Stewardship Act of 2000 to encourage coordinated, multi-agency, multi-institution approaches to translating ocean science to management and policy applications. The Marine Protected Areas Monitoring Enterprise was launched in 2007 under the auspices of the OST to lead development of efficient, cost-effective monitoring of the statewide marine protected areas (MPA) network being established under the Marine Life Protection Act. The MPA Monitoring Enterprise, which is supported by the Ocean Protection Council and works in partnership with the Department of Fish and Game, has two new job openings, for an Assistant Scientist and a Knowledge Manager. Both positions will be based in Oakland, California, in the offices of the OST. Start date for both positions is as soon as possible, preferably by March 1, 2010. Review of applications will begin January 4, 2010.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
Full position descriptions, which include application information, can be found at: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.calost.org/monitoring_ent.html&#x22;&#x3E;http://www.calost.org/monitoring_ent.html&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

<description>SCAMIT members, especially taxonomists from other Bight&#xA0;&#x2019;08 labs, are encouraged to attend to see the resolution process. Differences between primary and secondary identifications and counts will be resolved and error coded. There are always some interesting differences of taxonomic opinion and lab practice that pop up.</description>
