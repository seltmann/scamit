 The Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI), which is located in Charleston, South Carolina, has an Assistant Marine Scientist position available for an individual with experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy/systematics, preferably with research interest in biodiversity and/or biogeography. This position involves directing operation of the Southeastern Regional Taxonomic Center (SERTC), including curating and expanding the Center&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s specimen collection. The successful candidate will also be expected to conduct original research using the Center&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s resources, pursue extramural funding to ensure the Center&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s longevity and relevance, meet staffing needs, participate in educational activities, and represent the Center and promote its activities among staff of other institutions, universities and museums.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 This position requires a Ph.D. in marine science, zoology, ecology or biology, experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy and systematics, knowledge of basic collection curation, demonstrated strong technical writing skills, and good organizational and managerial skills. This position is currently fully funded for a period of one year at a starting base salary of $40,000 with full benefits, but has the potential to continue contingent upon the success of recent funding requests. Applicants must be legally authorized to work in the United States.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;

&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 The MESL laboratory specialises in analysis of benthic and epibenthic samples from a wide variety of environments ranging from estuarine to offshore. Primarily our work consists of monitoring for the aggregate industry and, more recently, the renewable energy sector. Our staff comprise of an experienced team of marine biologists who are self-motivated and work to tight deadlines.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 We are looking for a senior marine macrobenthic taxonomist whose primary role will be to undertake analysis of benthic samples and identification of all taxonomic groups, together with training of junior staff in benthic taxonomy. You will be educated to at least degree level in marine biology or a related discipline and also have at least two years experience in marine invertebrate analysis and taxonomic identification. While you will be mostly lab-based, you will also be required to participate in fieldwork.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 MESL participates in the NMBAQC scheme, and in conjunction with this, we run our own internal training scheme to develop the taxonomic skills of our laboratory staff. We also encourage continued professional development for all our staff.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
