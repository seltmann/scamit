 The MESL laboratory specialises in analysis of benthic and epibenthic samples from a wide variety of environments ranging from estuarine to offshore. Primarily our work consists of monitoring for the aggregate industry and, more recently, the renewable energy sector. Our staff comprise of an experienced team of marine biologists who are self-motivated and work to tight deadlines.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 We are looking for a senior marine macrobenthic taxonomist whose primary role will be to undertake analysis of benthic samples and identification of all taxonomic groups, together with training of junior staff in benthic taxonomy. You will be educated to at least degree level in marine biology or a related discipline and also have at least two years experience in marine invertebrate analysis and taxonomic identification. While you will be mostly lab-based, you will also be required to participate in fieldwork.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 MESL participates in the NMBAQC scheme, and in conjunction with this, we run our own internal training scheme to develop the taxonomic skills of our laboratory staff. We also encourage continued professional development for all our staff.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
