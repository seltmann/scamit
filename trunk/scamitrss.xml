&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 The Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI), which is located in Charleston, South Carolina, has an Assistant Marine Scientist position available for an individual with experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy/systematics, preferably with research interest in biodiversity and/or biogeography. This position involves directing operation of the Southeastern Regional Taxonomic Center (SERTC), including curating and expanding the Center&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s specimen collection. The successful candidate will also be expected to conduct original research using the Center&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s resources, pursue extramural funding to ensure the Center&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s longevity and relevance, meet staffing needs, participate in educational activities, and represent the Center and promote its activities among staff of other institutions, universities and museums.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 This position requires a Ph.D. in marine science, zoology, ecology or biology, experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy and systematics, knowledge of basic collection curation, demonstrated strong technical writing skills, and good organizational and managerial skills. This position is currently fully funded for a period of one year at a starting base salary of $40,000 with full benefits, but has the potential to continue contingent upon the success of recent funding requests. Applicants must be legally authorized to work in the United States.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 The SERTC is located within MRRI at the Marine Resources Center adjacent to Charleston Harbor. Institute staff interact routinely and extensively with staff at other facilities located at the Center, including the College of Charleston&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Grice Marine Laboratory, NOAA&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research, NOAA&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Hollings Marine Laboratory, NIST, and the Medical University of South Carolina&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Marine Biomedical Program. The successful applicant may apply for an adjunct faculty appointment in the College of Charleston&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Graduate Program in Marine Biology and/or Masters of Environmental Studies program. For more information, please visit SERTC (&#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/sertc/&#x22;&#x3E;http://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/sertc/&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 The MESL laboratory specialises in analysis of benthic and epibenthic samples from a wide variety of environments ranging from estuarine to offshore. Primarily our work consists of monitoring for the aggregate industry and, more recently, the renewable energy sector. Our staff comprise of an experienced team of marine biologists who are self-motivated and work to tight deadlines.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 We are looking for a senior marine macrobenthic taxonomist whose primary role will be to undertake analysis of benthic samples and identification of all taxonomic groups, together with training of junior staff in benthic taxonomy. You will be educated to at least degree level in marine biology or a related discipline and also have at least two years experience in marine invertebrate analysis and taxonomic identification. While you will be mostly lab-based, you will also be required to participate in fieldwork.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;
 MESL participates in the NMBAQC scheme, and in conjunction with this, we run our own internal training scheme to develop the taxonomic skills of our laboratory staff. We also encourage continued professional development for all our staff.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;

<description>The Bight&#xA0;&#x2019;08 QA review results indicated a need for a refresher on the species reported, literature being used, and understanding of the character states used to separate species. Those attending are asked to bring the literature they use and voucher specimens to the meeting. We will spend the morning reviewing the literature and the afternoon examining specimens.</description>

<description>Deb Paul, Morphbank FSU, will visit us to lead another workshop on Morphbank image submittal. We will receive hands on experience using two modes of image submittal. We will submit images using the online Morphbank website system in the morning, then use the newer spreadsheet submittal system in the afternoon. Those attending should bring 10 - 20 benthic invertebrate images with supporting collection information. This is planned as a productive day of uploading new images to Morphbank. Those who cannot attend will be able to follow the meeting online via SCCWRP&#x27;s web conferencing. Details for web access to follow.</description>
