   The MESL laboratory specialises in analysis of benthic and
   epibenthic samples from a wide variety of environments ranging from
   estuarine to offshore.  Primarily our work consists of monitoring
   for the aggregate industry and, more recently, the renewable energy
   sector.  Our staff comprise of an experienced team of marine
   biologists who are self-motivated and work to tight deadlines.<br />

   We are looking for a senior marine macrobenthic taxonomist whose
   primary role will be to undertake analysis of benthic samples and
   identification of all taxonomic groups, together with training of
   junior staff in benthic taxonomy.  You will be educated to at least
   degree level in marine biology or a related discipline and also
   have at least two years experience in marine invertebrate analysis
   and taxonomic identification.  While you will be mostly lab-based,
   you will also be required to participate in fieldwork.<br />

   MESL participates in the NMBAQC scheme, and in conjunction with
   this, we run our own internal training scheme to develop the
   taxonomic skills of our laboratory staff.  We also encourage
   continued professional development for all our staff.<br />
