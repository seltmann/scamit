      <p>The first two sections of the list (the front matter and the
      taxonomic listing) are available here for use electronically.
      The third section (index) is under construction and should be
      available shortly.  The listing is in a searchable PDF format,
      so you don't have to depend on the index.  Once the index is
      completed and posted the full document can be printed if a
      hard-copy is desired.  It will remain available in electronic
      format on the website until superceded by Ed 7 next July 1.</p>

<h2 class='hr'>Upcoming SCAMIT Meetings</h2>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><b>July 2011</b><br />

     field sampling efforts of Southern California POTW labs.</i></p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Aug15b'><b>Monday

     <i>Morphbank image submittal workshop</i>
     at SCCWRP in the large conference room.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Deb Paul, Morphbank FSU, will
  visit us to lead another workshop on Morphbank image submittal.  We
  will receive hands on experience using two modes of image submittal.
  We will submit images using the online Morphbank website system in
  the morning, then use the newer spreadsheet submittal system in the
  afternoon.  Those attending should bring 10 - 20 benthic
  invertebrate images with supporting collection information.  This is
  planned as a productive day of uploading new images to Morphbank.
  Those who cannot attend will be able to follow the meeting online
  via SCCWRP's web conferencing.  Details for web access to follow.</p>

     <i>Enteropneusta</i>
     at Lilly Pad Environmental, Escondido, CA (directions to follow).</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Megan will lead a workshop on
  Enteropneusta.  Those who plan to attend are asked to use their July
  field sampling events to pull specimens for special handling and
  preservation during collection.  That way materials in excellent
  condition will be available for the meeting.  We hope to improve the
  level of identification for this group at this meeting.</p>
