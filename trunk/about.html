<h2 class='hr'>History</h2><!-- page section title, first one has an 'hr' -->
<p>SCAMIT was formed in 1982 with the goal of promoting the study of
marine invertebrate taxonomy in Southern California and developing a
regionally standardized taxonomy. To accomplish this, SCAMIT provides
a regular monthly forum to address problems in taxonomy, organizes
taxonomic workshops, and maintains a reference collection and library
of taxonomic literature. SCAMIT&rsquo;s activities contribute to the
scientific value of the many surveys of marine benthic invertebrate
communities conducted in Southern California by assuring standardized
taxonomy and compatibility between various taxonomic data sets.</p>

<h2>SCAMIT Activities</h2>

<p>Members meet monthly (usually on the second Monday) in various
locations around Southern California. Our meetings include taxonomic
workshops and/or speakers who lecture on the systematics and related
ecology of a particular taxonomic group. Special workshops, by
visiting investigators and experts from various institutions and
museums, are also an integral part of SCAMIT. Descriptive information
and comparative characteristics of species examined during these
meetings are summarized in voucher sheets and tables distributed in
the <a href="/newsletters/">SCAMIT Newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to our standardization program, SCAMIT supports with a
<a href="/grants.html">grant program</a>
member projects to improve the quality of taxonomic data
through development and revision of taxonomic keys and publication of
new species descriptions. Members interested in applying for a
publication grant should
<a href="/grants.html">read the Taxonomic Publication Support Policy</a>
for further information and instructions.</p>

<p>In 1994, SCAMIT developed a comprehensive
listing of local marine invertebrates from the infaunal monitoring
programs in the Southern California Bight. This Taxonomic Listing of
Soft Bottom Macroinvertebrates is periodically updated as knowledge of
the marine invertebrate fauna expands.</p>

<p>The 5th Edition of <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><i>A
Taxonomic Listing of Macro- and Megainvertebrates from Infaunal &amp;
Epibenthic Monitoring Programs in the Southern California
Bight</i></a> has now been released and is available here for
downloading.</p>

<p>The 5th Edition expands on prior editions
by the addition of newly reported taxa from
publicly owned wastewater treatment works
monitoring programs and the Southern California Bight
2003 Regional Monitoring Project (Bight&rsquo;03).  The
inclusion of records from Bight&rsquo;03 expands the
list&rsquo;s coverage to depths of 1000m in nearshore basins
and megainvertebrates from trawls to depths of 500m in the Bight.
Geographic coverage begins at Point Conception,
includes Southern California bays
and harbors, six of the eight Channel Islands,
and the Mexican coastal shelf south to Bah&iacute;a Todos
Santos to a depth of 1000m.</p>

<p>The 5th Edition reflects the organisms collected from over 17,700
infaunal samples at 1,700+ sites and 4,300+ otter trawls at 650 sites
within the habitats covered. There are 2,551 species-level taxa on the
list representing 18 phyla, 37 classes, 111 orders, and 526 families.
The list has also been emended to reflect nomenclatural
changes since the previous edition.</p>

<h2>SCAMIT Support</h2>
<p>We are an entirely volunteer non-profit organization, with no
employees. Costs of newsletter production and distribution, 
website costs,
publication support grants, and stipends for out-of-area guest speakers
are virtually our only expenses. Dues from membership partially offset
these costs, but we also depend on financial support from outside
agencies.  Equally important is support of the agencies who allow
their officer employees to conduct SCAMIT business as part of their
work, and the companies and agencies that allow employee participation
at the monthly meetings. Without such support it would be very
difficult to find time to conduct the organization&rsquo;s business.  We are
also supported by the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History
(LACMNH), which provides us the physical space to maintain our voucher
specimen and literature collections. As an organization we owe all of
the above contributors and supporters a debt of gratitude.</p>

<h2>SCAMIT Members</h2>
<p>Initially formed by taxonomists associated with Southern California
wastewater treatment programs, the SCAMIT membership has diversified
over the years. It now also includes consultants, museum scientists,
and both students and researchers in the academic realm.  Despite our
local origins we have members from one coast of the U. S. to the
other, and a scattered contingent of international members. Distance
prevents most from active meeting participation, but we attempt to
include everyone through the newsletter and website.</p>

<h2>Alliances</h2>
<p>Besides the numerous public agencies with which SCAMIT is involved,
we are beginning to explore cooperation with other related organizations.
A recent contact is with the
<a href="http://www.safit.org/">Southwest Association of Freshwater
Invertebrate Taxonomists</a> (SAFIT).
The two organizations have jointly sponsored two taxonomic workshops
on fauna of common interest (hydrobiid snails and estuarine crustaceans).
We plan to continue that collaborative interaction with other topics in
the future.</p>
