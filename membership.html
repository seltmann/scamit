<p class='hr'>Membership renewals are due once a year in May.  This is the
beginning of our fiscal year and this will hopefully simplify the
renewal process for not only the Treasurer but all members. This also
allows SCAMIT a general yearly operating budget with which to plan
major expenses. General reminders will be posted on the website and in
the newsletter and if members haven't renewed by the end of May,
separate personal reminders will be sent to members in June.</p>

<p>New members may join at any time and will be informed of our annual
dues then. It has always been SCAMIT's policy not to drop members late
with their dues, especially long term members. This will continue. As
always if this presents any sort of difficulty for anyone please
contact the Treasurer, Cheryl Brantley
(<a href="mailto:cbrantley@lacsd.org">cbrantley@lacsd.org</a> or 
310.830.2400 x5605) directly to see what can be worked out.</p>
