    <h2>5th Edition!</h2>
      <p>The long awaited 5th Edition
      of <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><i>A Taxonomic Listing
      of Macro- and Megainvertebrates from Infaunal &amp; Epibenthic
      Monitoring Programs in the Southern California Bight</i></a> has
      now been released and is available here for downloading!</p>
      <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><img style='border:none;'
         src="/images/fifth-ed-cover-small.png"
         alt="5th Edition cover image" /></a>
      <p>The 5th Edition expands on prior editions by the addition of
      newly reported taxa from publicly owned wastewater treatment
      works monitoring programs and the Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;03).  The inclusion of
      records from Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;03 expands the list&rsquo;s coverage to
      depths of 1000&nbsp;m in nearshore basins and megainvertebrates from
      trawls to depths of 500&nbsp;m in the Bight.  Geographic coverage
      begins at Point Conception, includes Southern California bays
      and harbors, six of the eight Channel Islands, and the Mexican
      coastal shelf south to Bah&iacute;a Todos Santos to a depth of
      1000m.</p>
      <p>The Listing is in Portable Document Format (PDF) and is
      approximately 1.6&nbsp;MB long. Once downloaded, the PDF
      document may be viewed, searched and/or printed using the Adobe
      Acrobat Reader or other PDF readers.</p>

<h2 class='hr'>Upcoming SCAMIT Meetings</h2>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Nov15'><b>Monday
     15 November 2010 9:30 AM</b></a><br />
     <i>Mollusk literature review and Taxonomic Database
     testbed demo</i> at OCSD meeting room.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Mollusk literature review,
     followed by a demo of the testing version of the new
     Taxonomic Database. Non-mollusk taxonomists who are likely
     to be extensive users of the Taxonomic Database can attend
     the demo to see its features and provide feedback for further
     development.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Dec10'><b>Friday
     10 December 2010 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
     <i>Arthropoda: Crustacea literature review</i>
     at LACSD.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Don Cadien will lead a
     review of new Arthropoda:
     Crustacea literature with emphasis on papers reporting newly
     described/reported species to S. Cal. or revisionary papers
     effecting name usage or taxonomic hierarchy of our local fauna.
     Dr. Mary Wicksten will be attend the meeting to contribute and
     discuss her recent work on Eastern Pacific decapods.  I hope all
     our local crustacean taxonomists will plan on attending this
     meeting.  Don will be sending out more information prior to the
     meeting.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Dec11'><b>Saturday
     11 December 2010 5:30&ndash;9:00&nbsp;PM</b></a><br />
     <i>SCAMIT Christmas Party</i>
     at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>All SCAMIT members and their
     families are invited to attend.  In
     addition, the officers decided it would be neighborly to invite
     members and their families of our two sister groups to join us.
     Invitations will be extended to the members of the Southwestern
     Association of Freshwater Invertebrate Taxonomists (SAFIT) and
     the Southern California Association of Ichthyological Taxonomists
     and Ecologists (SCAITE).  It should make for a lively event.
     More details later.</p>
