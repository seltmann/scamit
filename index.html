    <h2>5th Edition!</h2>
      <p>The long awaited 5th Edition
      of <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><i>A Taxonomic Listing
      of Macro- and Megainvertebrates from Infaunal &amp; Epibenthic
      Monitoring Programs in the Southern California Bight</i></a> has
      now been released and is available here for downloading!</p>
      <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><img style='border:none;'
         src="/images/fifth-ed-cover-small.png"
         alt="5th Edition cover image" /></a>
      <p>The 5th Edition expands on prior editions by the addition of
      newly reported taxa from publicly owned wastewater treatment
      works monitoring programs and the Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;03).  The inclusion of
      records from Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;03 expands the list&rsquo;s coverage to
      depths of 1000&nbsp;m in nearshore basins and megainvertebrates from
      trawls to depths of 500&nbsp;m in the Bight.  Geographic coverage
      begins at Point Conception, includes Southern California bays
      and harbors, six of the eight Channel Islands, and the Mexican
      coastal shelf south to Bah&iacute;a Todos Santos to a depth of
      1000m.</p>
      <p>The Listing is in Portable Document Format (PDF) and is
      approximately 1.6&nbsp;MB long. Once downloaded, the PDF
      document may be viewed, searched and/or printed using the Adobe
      Acrobat Reader or other PDF readers.</p>

<h2 class='hr'>Upcoming SCAMIT Meetings</h2>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Sep13'><b>Monday
     13 September 2010 9:30 AM</b></a><br />
     <i>Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 QA review
     meeting with LACSD, City of LA, and ABC Labs</i>
     at LACSD labs.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>SCAMIT members, especially
     taxonomists from other Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 labs, are encouraged to attend
     to see the resolution process.  Differences between primary and
     secondary identifications and counts will be resolved and error
     coded.  There are always some interesting differences of
     taxonomic opinion and lab practice that pop up.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Oct04'><b>Monday
     4 October 2010 9:30&ndash;3:30</b>
     </a><br />
     <i>Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 QA review
     meeting with LACSD and City of SD</i>
     at City of San Diego lab.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>SCAMIT members, especially
     taxonomists from other Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 labs, are encouraged to attend
     to see the resolution process.  Differences between primary and
     secondary identifications and counts will be resolved and error
     coded.  There are always some interesting differences of
     taxonomic opinion and lab practice that pop up.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Oct18'><b>Monday
     18 October 2010 9:30 AM</b></a><br />
     <i>Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 synoptic data review meeting</i>
     at SCCWRP Medium Conference Room.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>The compiled
     Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 species list from all stations will be
     reviewed for taxonomic consistency. The resulting final species
     list will be used in Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 infaunal data analyses.  All
     Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 taxonomists are encouraged to attend this
     important meeting in case specific questions on taxonomic
     consistency arise.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Dec11'><b>Saturday
     11 December 2010 5:30&ndash;9:00&nbsp;PM</b></a><br />
     <i>SCAMIT Christmas Party</i>
     at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>All SCAMIT members and their
     families are invited to attend.  In
     addition, the officers decided it would be neighborly to invite
     members and their families of our two sister groups to join us.
     Invitations will be extended to the members of the Southwestern
     Association of Freshwater Invertebrate Taxonomists (SAFIT) and
     the Southern California Association of Ichthyological Taxonomists
     and Ecologists (SCAITE).  It should make for a lively event.
     More details later.</p>
