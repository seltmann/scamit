    <h2>5th Edition!</h2>
      <p>The long awaited 5th Edition
      of <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><i>A Taxonomic Listing
      of Macro- and Megainvertebrates from Infaunal &amp; Epibenthic
      Monitoring Programs in the Southern California Bight</i></a> has
      now been released and is available here for downloading!</p>
      <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><img style='border:none;'
         src="/images/fifth-ed-cover-small.png"
         alt="5th Edition cover image" /></a>
      <p>The 5th Edition expands on prior editions by the addition of
      newly reported taxa from publicly owned wastewater treatment
      works monitoring programs and the Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;03).  The inclusion of
      records from Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;03 expands the list&rsquo;s coverage to
      depths of 1000&nbsp;m in nearshore basins and megainvertebrates from
      trawls to depths of 500&nbsp;m in the Bight.  Geographic coverage
      begins at Point Conception, includes Southern California bays
      and harbors, six of the eight Channel Islands, and the Mexican
      coastal shelf south to Bah&iacute;a Todos Santos to a depth of
      1000m.</p>
      <p>The Listing is in Portable Document Format (PDF) and is
      approximately 1.6&nbsp;MB long. Once downloaded, the PDF
      document may be viewed, searched and/or printed using the Adobe
      Acrobat Reader or other PDF readers.</p>

<h2 class='hr'>Upcoming SCAMIT Meetings</h2>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='May16'><b>Monday
     16 May 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
     <i>Ostracod family Cylindroleberididae species review and workshop</i>
        at City of San Diego Environmental Monitoring Lab.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>The Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 QA
  review results indicated a need for a refresher on the species
  reported, literature being used, and understanding of the character
  states used to separate species.  Those attending are asked to bring
  the literature they use and voucher specimens to the meeting.  We
  will spend the morning reviewing the literature and the afternoon
  examining specimens.</p>


  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='June13'><b>Monday
     13 June 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
     <i>Oligochaetes with Dr. Joshua Mackie of SJSU</i>
     at NHMLAC.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Dr. Mackie has been doing the
  oligochaete identifications for the MLML ISS samples and will be
  sharing his findings and oligochaete identification techniques.
  This should be an informative meeting on a subject we have little
  experience with.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><b>July 2011</b><br />
     <i>No meeting scheduled due to member involvement in the extensive
     field sampling efforts of Southern California POTW labs.</i></p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Aug15'><b>Monday
     15 August 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
     <i>Morphbank image submittal workshop</i>
     at SCCWRP in the large conference room.</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Deb Paul, Morphbank FSU, will
  visit us to lead another workshop on Morphbank image submittal.  We
  will receive hands on experience using two modes of image submittal.
  We will submit images using the online Morphbank website system in
  the morning, then use the newer spreadsheet submittal system in the
  afternoon.  Those attending should bring 10 - 20 benthic
  invertebrate images with supporting collection information.  This is
  planned as a productive day of uploading new images to Morphbank.
  Those who cannot attend will be able to follow the meeting online
  via SCCWRP's web conferencing.  Details for web access to follow.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name='Sep2011'><b><i>[date TBA]</i>
     September 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
     <i>Enteropneusta</i>
     at Lilly Pad Environmental, Escondido, CA (directions to follow).</p>
  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Megan will lead a workshop on
  Enteropneusta.  Those who plan to attend are asked to use their July
  field sampling events to pull specimens for special handling and
  preservation during collection.  That way materials in excellent
  condition will be available for the meeting.  We hope to improve the
  level of identification for this group at this meeting.</p>

  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name=''><b>Monday
      17 October 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
      <i>Enopla Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 specialty taxonomy presentation</i>
      at OCSD.</p>

  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Tony Phillips will present his
  findings from the Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 samples.  He will review the
  characters used to identify the species and have specimens for
  examination.  Bring any strange enoplans from your regular samples
  you need help with to this meeting.</p>


  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name=''><b>Monday
      14 November 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
      <i>Syllidae Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 specialty taxonomy presentation</i>
      at City of San Diego Environmental Monitoring Lab.</p>

  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Ron Velarde will present the
  results of his Bight&nbsp;&rsquo;08 work on this difficult
  polychaete family.  There will be updates to the current name usage
  presented and important character states will be reviewed.  There is
  sure to be new information on this family presented at this
  meeting.  </p>


  <p class='hang rsstitle'><a name=''><b>Monday
      12 December 2011 9:30&ndash;3:30</b></a><br />
      <i>SCB isopod review</i>
      at City of San Diego Environmental Monitoring Lab.</p>

  <p class='indent smallsize rssdesc'>Dr. Tim Stebbins will lead a
  review of the isopod fauna reported from the Southern California
  Bight.  He will present images and discuss aspects of isopod
  taxonomy and ecology.  This will be the first of several review
  meetings on isopods planned by Tim.  </p>
