  The Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI), which is located in
  Charleston, South Carolina, has an Assistant Marine Scientist

  in biodiversity and/or biogeography.  This position involves
  directing operation of the Southeastern Regional Taxonomic Center
  (SERTC), including curating and expanding the Center’s specimen
  collection.  The successful candidate will also be expected to
  conduct original research using the Center’s resources, pursue
  extramural funding to ensure the Center’s longevity and relevance,
  meet staffing needs, participate in educational activities, and
  represent the Center and promote its activities among staff of other
  institutions, universities and museums.<br />
  
  This position requires a Ph.D. in marine science, zoology, ecology
  or biology, experience in marine invertebrate taxonomy and
  systematics, knowledge of basic collection curation, demonstrated
  strong technical writing skills, and good organizational and

  period of one year at a starting base salary of $40,000 with full
  benefits, but has the potential to continue contingent upon the
  success of recent funding requests. Applicants must be legally
  authorized to work in the United States.<br />

  The SERTC is located within MRRI at the Marine Resources Center
  adjacent to Charleston Harbor.  Institute staff interact routinely
  and extensively with staff at other facilities located at the

  <p class='job rssdesc'><i>1 September 2010</a><br />

   <a href='http://www.seasurvey.co.uk/vacancies'>Senior Marine Macrobenthic Taxonomist</a><br />

   The MESL laboratory specialises in analysis of benthic and
   epibenthic samples from a wide variety of environments ranging from
   estuarine to offshore.  Primarily our work consists of monitoring
   for the aggregate industry and, more recently, the renewable energy
   sector.  Our staff comprise of an experienced team of marine
   biologists who are self-motivated and work to tight deadlines.<br />

   We are looking for a senior marine macrobenthic taxonomist whose
   primary role will be to undertake analysis of benthic samples and
   identification of all taxonomic groups, together with training of
   junior staff in benthic taxonomy.  You will be educated to at least
   degree level in marine biology or a related discipline and also
   have at least two years experience in marine invertebrate analysis
   and taxonomic identification.  While you will be mostly lab-based,
   you will also be required to participate in fieldwork.<br />

   MESL participates in the NMBAQC scheme, and in conjunction with
   this, we run our own internal training scheme to develop the
   taxonomic skills of our laboratory staff.  We also encourage
   continued professional development for all our staff.<br />
