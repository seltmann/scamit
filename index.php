    <h2>5th Edition!</h2>
      <p>The long awaited 5th Edition
      of <a href="/publications/SCAMIT-ed5.pdf"><i>A Taxonomic Listing
      of Macro- and Megainvertebrates from Infaunal &amp; Epibenthic
      Monitoring Programs in the Southern California Bight</i></a> has
      now been released and is available here for downloading!</p>

         src="/images/fifth-ed-cover-small.png"
         alt="5th Edition cover image" /></a>
      <p>The 5th Edition expands on prior editions by the addition of
      newly reported taxa from publicly owned wastewater treatment
      works monitoring programs and the Southern California Bight 2003
      Regional Monitoring Project (Bight&rsquo;03).  The inclusion of
      records from Bight&rsquo;03 expands the list&rsquo;s coverage to
      depths of 1000&nbsp;m in nearshore basins and megainvertebrates from
      trawls to depths of 500&nbsp;m in the Bight.  Geographic coverage
      begins at Point Conception, includes Southern California bays
      and harbors, six of the eight Channel Islands, and the Mexican
      coastal shelf south to Bah&iacute;a Todos Santos to a depth of
      1000m.</p>
      <p>The Listing is in Portable Document Format (PDF) and is
      approximately 1.6&nbsp;MB long. Once downloaded, the PDF
      document may be viewed, searched and/or printed using the Adobe
      Acrobat Reader or other PDF readers.</p>
